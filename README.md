# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Student-Reviews

This project uses an ensemble model consisting of Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and Complement Naive Bayes to analyze positive, neutral, and negative sentiment from student reviews with an accuracy of 90.62%.

Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of reviews from Coursera, collected using a web scraper built with BeautifulSoup.

Web Applications

Coursera URL Review Scraper: Accepts a Coursera URL, scrapes the reviews into a new CSV file, and classifies the sentiments of the reviews.
